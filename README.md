## spotcontrol

Spotcontrol is an open source library for controlling spotify connect devices based on the [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) project.  

Spotcontrol is a golang port of a small subset of the librespot functionality, focusing soley on controlling other devices, it does not offer any support for actual music playback.  A simple [cli example](https://github.com/badfortrains/spotcontrol_example) demonstrates the key features of the library (loading tracks, playing, pausing).
