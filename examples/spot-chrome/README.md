## Spotcontrol chrome app

Basic chrome extension using [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) to translate spotcontrol to javascript.

Uses [Chrome tcp sockets](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/sockets_tcp) for network communication.

Currently supports "play", "pause", and setting device volume.
